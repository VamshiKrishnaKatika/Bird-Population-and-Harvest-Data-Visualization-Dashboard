# Bird-Population-and-Harvest-Data-Visualization-Dashboard

## Overview
This project, focuses on revolutionizing the data management practices of the Division of Migratory Bird Management (DMBM) for migratory game birds across the United States. The primary objective is to streamline and automate the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting population and harvest data, specifically focusing on abundance data. 

By leveraging advanced data management techniques and visualization tools, the project aims to establish a centralized digital repository accessible nationwide, enhancing data flow and accessibility for informed decision-making. This initiative seeks to improve data accessibility, management efficiency, and foster collaboration and innovation in migratory bird conservation.

## Project Objectives
- Streamline and automate data collection processes.
- Enhance the analysis and reporting of population and harvest data.
- Establish a centralized digital repository for nationwide data accessibility.
- Develop an interactive Tableau dashboard for advanced data visualization and analysis.
- Uncover patterns, trends, and relationships crucial for the long-term sustainability of migratory bird populations.
- Improve data accessibility and management efficiency.
- Foster collaboration and innovation in migratory bird conservation.
